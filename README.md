# DSA-resources
Assignments and Exams I worked on in a DSA class in summer of 2023

When opening in VS Code, I highly recommend to not open the repository with all the labs. Open just one lab otherwise pytest may run into errors.

If you want to run  the testing python files, I recommend to move the lab's python files in the same directory so pytest does not run into errors.
